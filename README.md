Forked Repository from http://github.com/gabonator/DS203
--------------------------------------------------------

Gabonator's (http://www.valky.eu) firmware is described as a better UI than the original but that undersells it significantly.  The UI is indeed far more scope like and very easy to use but I also I keep on uncovering more under the hood.  Even so, there were a few things that I wanted to do with it so created this fork.

See the wiki pages for the changes and changelog

The code compiles out the box with Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop.
Installing the hex files is exactly the same as upstream
